    body: "Combat sports are the most honest sports in the world. They also carry real risk — every amateur, coach, and parent deserves tools to train harder and protect the brain doing it. HitSmart is an AI coach built for that reality: technique feedback, sparring analysis, and a head-impact counter that helps you see what your body's actually absorbing. Built by fighters, for fighters."
