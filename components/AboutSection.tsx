            I&apos;ve generated over 70 million views and 100,000 followers in the
            combat sports niche over the past few years. I&apos;m a fighter myself
            — I trained and coached at McGill&apos;s boxing club. I know how to
            edit, I know how to make videos people actually watch, and I know
            how to grow accounts from zero. I&apos;m ready to bring all of that to
            your gym.
